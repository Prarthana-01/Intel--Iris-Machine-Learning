# Intel--Iris-Machine-Learning
1. In this project, we build a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into one of three species based on their physical attributes. With just a few simple measurements, we can predict whether an iris is a Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica!

ðŸ§  How It Works
Load the Dataset: We load the Iris dataset which contains flower measurements and species labels.
Preprocess the Data: Standardize the feature data to ensure it is scaled properly for model training.
Train the Model: We use Logistic Regression, a powerful classification algorithm, to train our model on the dataset.
Make Predictions: The model is used to predict the species of new iris flowers based on their measurements.
Evaluate the Model: We evaluate the performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix.

ðŸŽ¯ Results
After training the model, we achieved a high accuracy in predicting the species of iris flowers, with 100% accuracy in most cases. ðŸŽ‰
Here are the performance metrics:
Accuracy: 100%
Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Excellent performance across all classes.
Confusion Matrix: Visual representation of model predictions vs actual species.
